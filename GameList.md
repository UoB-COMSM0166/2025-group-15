2. **Multiple Modes and Scenarios:**  
   - Develop various game modes (Survival, Time Challenge, etc.).  
   - Create different map layouts with obstacles and traps.  
   - Add character variety (such as agility, appearance traits, etc.).  

3. **Enhanced Interaction and Feedback:**  
   - Dynamic sound effects and visual effects enhance the game presentation.  
   - Real-time display of scores, remaining time, and BOSS statuses to enhance player immersion.  
   - Randomly generated items and obstacles during gameplay.

### 2. Traffic Theft

#### **Introduction**  
Traffic Theft is a fast-paced minigame in *Pummel Party* where players compete to score the most points within 3 minutes. Players must collect cash and gold from a building, cross a dangerous street with constant traffic, and deposit their loot at a scoring machine on the opposite side. Each cash pile is worth 1 point, and each gold bar is worth 2 points when successfully deposited. The challenge comes from the movement penalty — the more items you carry, the slower you move, making it harder to dodge traffic!
