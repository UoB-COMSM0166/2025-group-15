## 2. Traffic Theft
#### **Introduction**  
Traffic Theft is a fast-paced minigame in *Pummel Party* where players compete to score the most points within 3 minutes. Players must collect cash and gold from a building, cross a dangerous street with constant traffic, and deposit their loot at a scoring machine on the opposite side. Each cash pile is worth 1 point, and each gold bar is worth 2 points when successfully deposited. The challenge comes from the movement penalty — the more items you carry, the slower you move, making it harder to dodge traffic!
