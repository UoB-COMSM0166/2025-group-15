## Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel? 

### Requirements 

- 15% ~750 words
- Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop? 

#### Stakeholders
<!-- 【DDL周六晚24点前】表格 -->
**User Story 7:**  
- **As a** developer, **I want** to break down the game development process into modular components,  **so that** each team member can work independently on different parts of the game.  

**Acceptance Criteria 7:**  
- **Given** a structured game development plan, **when** a team member starts working on a specific module,  **then** they should be able to develop, test, and integrate their module without being blocked by dependencies.  

---
**User Story 8 :**  
- **As a** developer, **I want** to design background music and various sound effects, **so that** players can experience greater immersion in the game.  

**Acceptance Criteria 8 :**  
- **Given** a specific game scene or event, **when** background music and sound effects are played, **then** they should match the atmosphere and enhance the player's engagement.  

---
**User Story 9 :**  
- **As a** developer, **I want** to implement high-quality artwork and animations, **so that** players can have a visually engaging and enjoyable experience.  

**Acceptance Criteria 9:**
