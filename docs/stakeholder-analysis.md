# Stakeholder Analysis

We applied the Onion Model to identify and analyze stakeholders involved in our game development:

| Layer | Stakeholder | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Core Layer | Development Team | Responsible for game design, programming, art creation, and initial testing |
| Inner Layer | Project Supervisors | Guide development process and evaluate project quality, providing critical feedback |
| Middle Layer | Beta Testers | Early players who test gameplay mechanics and provide feedback on user experience |
| Outer Layer | Target Players | Final users who will play the completed game |
| Outer Layer | Platform Provider | Distribution platform (e.g., Steam, App Store) hosting the game |
